The intact black granit stela has twenty-six registers of beautifully inscribed hieroglyphs.  The large top register shows two scenes of the king offering homage to the king of gods and god of the sky, Amen-Re, while the goddess of warfare (?), Neith, looks on.  The god recounts the victories of his son, King Thutmose, and reminds him of the many achievements and conquests achieved with the god's help.  The text names one of the countries Thutmose conquered and battles he fought all the way to Mesopotamia.

In 1895 Jacques de Morgan found the exquisite treasure of Princess Khnumet at Dashur.  Among the jewelry pieces were two gold diadems.  One circlet (left) is composed of rosettes and lyre-shaped pieces, with eight uprights, that are inlaid in lapis lazuli, red jasper and green feldspar.  Another delicate diadem (right) is interlaced in finely made wires of gold interspersed with tiny star-shaped flowers caught together by six Maltese cross forms.  An aigrette as a spray of golden leaves (center) was also found.  Such ornaments were too fragile to actually wear and were fashioned for the burial.

Arabs thought the rotund figure looked like a village headman, ergo its name.  The frontal position, forward stride, and steady gaze present a style typical of Old Kingdom sculpture.  The arms have been pegged to the upper body and the once-missing feet were restored, possibly by the conservator Alexandre Barsanti (1858-1917).  The eyes are of opaque white quartz set in copper to suggest lids, and rock crystal disks are the pupils.  The statue was found at Sakkara, along with a wooden statue of the subject's wife in the chapel of the mastaba tomb of a priest and high official, Ka-aper, who lived in Memphis around 2450 B.C. The statue was found during the course of Auguste Mariette's excavation.  The once-painted masterpiece was exhibited for the first time at the Boulaq Museum, where it was placed on a pedestal in the Center Gallery and protected by a waist-high brass guardrail.",egypt068,A1: 621 Egypt 5S,"Digital Image Copyright (c) 2003.
